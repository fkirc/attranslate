macOS/Ubuntu/Windows: [![Actions Status](https://github.com/fkirc/attranslate/workflows/Tests/badge.svg/?branch=master)](https://github.com/fkirc/attranslate/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)

`attranslate` is a semi-automated tool for "synchronizing" translation-files.
`attranslate` works with or without automated translation-services.
For example, let's say that a translation-service achieves 80% correct translations.
Thanks to `attranslate`, a quick fix of the remaining 20% is faster than doing everything by hand.
Other than that, `attranslate` supports manual translations and even file-format-conversions without changing the language.

## Why attranslate?

In contrast to paid services, a single developer can integrate `attranslate` in a matter of minutes.
In contrast to many other tools, `attranslate` can operate on the very same translations-files that you are already using.
This is possible because `attranslate` operates on your file in a surgical way, with as little changes as possible.
See [tools comparison](/docs/TOOL_COMPARISON.md) for an overview about translation-tools.

# Features

## Cross-platform Support

`attranslate` is designed to translate any website or app with any toolchain.
`attranslate` works for i18n/JavaScript-frameworks/Android/iOS/Flutter/Ruby/Jekyll/Symfony/Django/WordPress and many other platforms.
To make this possible, `attranslate` supports the following file formats:

- Flat or nested JSON
- Flat or nested YAML
- PO/POT-files
- Android-XML or any other XMLs with text-contents
- iOS-Strings
- Flutter-ARB

## Seamless Manual Corrections

`attranslate` recognizes that automated translations are not perfect.
Therefore, whenever you are unhappy with the produced results, `attranslate` allows you to simply overwrite texts in your target-files.
`attranslate` will never ever overwrite a manual correction in subsequent runs.

## Support For Manual Reviews

Optionally, `attranslate` marks newly generated texts with a "review-notice".
This helps to keep track of which texts have been already reviewed by a human.

## Available Services

`attranslate` supports the following translation-services:

- [Google Cloud Translate](https://cloud.google.com/translate)
- [DeepL](https://deepl.com)
- [Azure Translator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/translator-text-api/)
- `manual`: Translate texts manually by entering them into `attranslate`.
- `sync-without-translate`: Does not change the language. This can be useful for converting between file formats, or for maintaining region-specific differences.

## High Performance

If some texts have already been translated, then `attranslate` won't translate them again.
This does not only speedup your workflow, but also saves cost for paid translation-services.

## Detect Common Mistakes

Although (some) humans have excellent translation-skills, humans are notoriously bad at detecting "trivial" mistakes like outdated, missing, stale or duplicate translations.
In contrast, `attranslate` detects such "trivial" mistakes with 100% reliability.

# Usage Examples

Translating a single file is as simple as the following line:

```
attranslate --srcFile=json-simple/en.json --srcLng=en --srcFormat=nested-json --targetFile=json-simple/de.json --targetLng=de --targetFormat=nested-json --service=manual
```

If you have multiple target-languages, then you will need multiple calls to `attranslate`.
You can write something like the following script to avoid unnecessary duplication:

```bash
# This example translates an english JSON-file into spanish, chinese and german. It uses Google Cloud Translate.
BASE_DIR="json-manual-review"
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY="gcloud/gcloud_service_account.json"
COMMON_ARGS=( "--srcLng=en" "--srcFormat=nested-json" "--targetFormat=nested-json" "--service=google-translate" "--serviceConfig=$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY" "--manualReview=true" "--cacheDir=$BASE_DIR" "--matcher=i18next" )

# Run "npm install --global attranslate" before you try this example.
attranslate --srcFile=$BASE_DIR/en/fruits.json --targetFile=$BASE_DIR/es/fruits.json --targetLng=es "${COMMON_ARGS[@]}"
attranslate --srcFile=$BASE_DIR/en/fruits.json --targetFile=$BASE_DIR/zh/fruits.json --targetLng=zh "${COMMON_ARGS[@]}"
attranslate --srcFile=$BASE_DIR/en/fruits.json --targetFile=$BASE_DIR/de/fruits.json --targetLng=de "${COMMON_ARGS[@]}"
```

Similarly, you can use `attranslate` to convert between file-formats.
See [sample scripts](/sample-scripts) for more examples.

# Integration Guide

Firstly, ensure that [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your machine.
Once you have `nodejs`, you can install `attranslate` via:

`npm install --global attranslate`

Alternatively, if you are a JavaScript-developer, then you should install `attranslate` via:

`npm install --save-dev attranslate`

Next, you should write a project-specific script that invokes `attranslate` for your specific files.
See [sample scripts](/sample-scripts) for guidance on how to translate your project-specific files.

## Service Configuration

If you use `attranslate` with an automated translation-service, then you need to configure an API-key.
API-keys can be obtained for free, but you might need to register an account.
See [service config](docs/SERVICE_CONFIG.md) for guidance on how to obtain API-keys for specific services.

Once you have an API-key, pass your API-key to `attranslate` via the `--serviceConfig` flag.

## Interpolations and Matchers

> :warning: For many projects, `attranslate` works out of the box without configuring any matchers. Therefore, we recommend skipping this section unless you encounter unexpected problems that are hard to fix manually.

Many websites/apps use _interpolations_  to insert dynamic values into translations.
For example, an interpolation like `Your name is {{name}}` might be replaced with `Your name is Felix`.

To help with interpolations, `attranslate` provides so-called _matchers_.
A matcher replaces interpolations with placeholders before they are
sent to a translation service.
`attranslate` offers the following matchers for different styles of interpolations:

- **ICU**: Matches ICU interpolations like `{name}`.
- **i18n**: Matches [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/interpolation) interpolations like `{{name}}`.
- **sprintf**: Matches sprintf-style interpolations like `%s`.
- **None**: Doesn't match any interpolations.

You can select a matcher with the `--matcher` option.

## Translation Cache

The translation-cache is an essential part of `attranslate`.
The purpose is twofold:

- The translation-cache enables selective corrections if you are not happy with automatically generated translations.
- The translation-cache saves time and cost because it prevents redundant re-translations.

The translation-cache consists of `attranslate-cache-*`-files.
It is allowed to delete a translation-cache at any time.
However, to make it work smoothly, you should put your `attranslate-cache-*`-files under version control.

## Continuous Integration

To detect common mistakes like missing translations, it is advisable to run `attranslate` via continuous integration (CI).
For example, the command `git diff --exit-code` can be used to trigger a CI failure whenever a file has been modified by `attranslate`.
