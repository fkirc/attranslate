# Operation Modes

When generating target files, attranslate has the following two operation modes:

- `Source-tree preservation`
- `Tree-generation from scratch`

attranslate tries to use `Source-tree preservation` as often as possible, and only uses `Tree-generation from scratch` as a fallback.
Moreover, attranslate has the rule that source files are *never* modified, only the target files are modified or generated.
This document describes the two operation modes in more detail.

## Source-tree preservation

This operation mode creates a tree representation of the source file (e.g., nested JSON/YAML/XML).
Then it traverses the source tree to find translatable entries.
If available, it also traverses the old target file to find already translated entries.
Crucially, the same source tree is used for generating the target file.
Only the translatable entries are swapped; the rest of the source tree is left as-is.
This operation mode has several advantages:

- Maintains an excellent consistency between source and target
- Good preservation of comments and auxiliary data
- After an initial ramp-up, it is guaranteed that target translations are never accidentally overwritten
- Simple implementation
- Relatively robust when dealing with complex files

Nevertheless, we realize that source-tree preservation is not suited for every user.
In particular, source-tree preservation might be problematic for users who have wildly inconsistent target files and are unable or unwilling to make them consistent.

## Tree-generation from scratch

This operation mode is mainly intended as a fallback for the case that one file format is transformed into another file format (e.g., JSON to YAML or vice versa).
Depending on the file format, the tree-generation from scratch might lead to a certain loss of information.
For example, this operation mode can only generate very primitive YAML files and might be unable to preserve complex tree structures.
