# Service Configuration

Currently, you need to obtain an API-key if you use `attranslate` with automated translation-services.
This document provides guidance on how to obtain API-keys for specific services.
Once you have an API-key, pass your API-key to `attranslate` via the `--serviceConfig`-flag.

### Google Translate

Follow these steps to get an API-key for Google Translate:

1.  [Select or create a Cloud project][projects]
2.  [Enable the Google Cloud Translation API][enable_api]
3.  [Create a service account][auth] to obtain a `service_account_key.json`-file.

[projects]: https://console.cloud.google.com/project
[billing]: https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing
[enable_api]:
  https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=translate.googleapis.com
[auth]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started

Once you have a service account, pass a path to your `service_account_key.json` via the `--serviceConfig`-flag to `attranslate`.

### Azure Translator

- [Sign Up](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) for an

# Service Tuning

Enterprise users can tune translation-services according to their needs.
For example, enterprise users can deploy custom glossaries with domain-specific vocabulary, or they can even train their own machine-learning models.
However, for entry-level users, it is often faster to omit service-tuning and do a few more manual corrections instead.
This is why `attranslate` provides first-class support for manual corrections.
