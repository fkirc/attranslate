# AGENTS.md

Always do a build before executing tests:

- npm run build
- npm run test

Do NOT work on files in the dist-folder, because the dist-folder is auto-generated by the npm run build command.

When working on unit-tests, see docs/DEV_MANIFESTO.md for details regarding our test philosophy.

When asked for new features, only implement the logic that is requested. Do not implement new logic just because you assume that a user-base exists for it.

## Code Reviews

Do code reviews from the eyes of a critical senior dev, and consider the following things:

- Only review differences between the current branch and the master-branch.
- Check if the current branch is up-to-date with the master-branch. If not, then suggest to pull from master.
- Check critically if logic works as intended.
- Check critical if changes introduce regression.
- Check for obvious code smells or spelling mistakes.
